configurations, and custom fields/records/forms/roles within multiple NetSuite accounts (sandboxes/production).
It is currently in the **very** early stages of development.

- Automatically deploy custom forms/fields/records/roles
- Document custom SuiteScripts application and use within NetSuite
- Track deployment schedules and developer resources by environment (DEV,TEST,PROD)
- Track differences between sandbox and production (or multiple sandboxes, ie DEV, TEST, PROD)


### Current Dependencies
